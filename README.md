# AI-Powered Smart Cane

This project is an intelligent navigation aid designed to enhance independence and safety for visually impaired individuals. More than just a walking stick, it acts as a **personal guide**, combining computer vision, smart alerts, and real-time assistance in an affordable form.

## Key Features

- **Object Detection (YOLOv8):** Identifies obstacles in real time and warns the user before accidents occur.
- **Text Recognition (EasyOCR):** Reads signs, labels, and documents aloud.
- **Face Recognition:** Helps identify familiar people, adding a social-awareness dimension.
- **Speech & Haptic Feedback:** Provides intuitive guidance through voice instructions and gentle vibrations.
- **GPS Emergency Alerts:** Shares live location instantly in case of danger or emergencies.
- **Smartphone Integration:** Uses the phoneâ€™s processing power and camera, making the system lightweight, fast, and cost-effective.

## Why It Matters

Traditional canes provide mobility but limited environmental awareness. This smart cane extends functionality by enabling users to **see, read, recognize, and navigate** with greater confidence.

## Tech Stack

- **AI/ML:** YOLOv8, TensorFlow, OpenCV
- **Vision & Text:** EasyOCR, Face Recognition libraries
- **Hardware:** Arduino + Haptic motors
- **App Development:** Flutter (Android)
- **Other:** GPS integration, Speech synthesis

## Vision

The goal is to build a solution that is **accessible, affordable, and practical** for everyday use, with potential for real-world deployment and future commercialization.

Ongoing work focuses on improving app performance, optimizing AI models, and exploring patent and market opportunities.
